At the time of writing, Halloween is still more than a month away. However, due to a terrible experience years ago, I absolutely detest it, and I shudder every time someone mentions it. In fact, I can't even talk about it without getting angry, so I've had to compose this melody instead:

Can you find the flag, which explains why I dislike Halloween so much?
