It looked like such a simple bugfix on the surface. However, the code makes no sense to you - ampersands, interrobangs, `GO FROM` and `MEANWHILE` are spread throughout the source code like confetti. You realize that this is Visual INTERCAL code, and you immediately realize that you need help.

Can you find DIPS' one expert in Visual INTERCAL?

(Note that this challenge requires access to the DIPS intranet.)
