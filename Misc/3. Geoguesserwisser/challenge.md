I've already finished planning next year's summer vacation - and I know exactly where I'm going:

* 52.516346, 13.378326
* 61.775819, 4.897117
* 55.401126, 10.387552
* 61.552165, 8.484399
* 69.648022, 18.934876

My friends are bewildered, but I know you've already figured out why I've picked these spots!

The flag is `d:ctf{the-theme-of-my-summer-vacation-is-SECRET-THEME}` with `SECRET-THEME` swapped out with the theme (two words) which links all of the destinations.
