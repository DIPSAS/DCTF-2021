After a daring heist, you've escaped from the secret laboratory with the mysterious device.

The device, adorned with two buttons, a big LED screen, and a sticky note saying "PROPERTY OF THE BEEB", does not seem to be doing anything right now.

However, you've also made off with a flash drive labelled "UNIVERSAL HEX" which you think may be the key to unlocking the device. The drive contains a single file named `secret-box.hex`.

Can you uncover the Beeb's secret?
