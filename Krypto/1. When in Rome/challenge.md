JÃ¸rgen has come up with a simple but effective way to encrypt his diary entries. 

He has tried his encryption scheme on the flag: `f:evh{ytkvg-eqfg-ykvj-ogcpkpi}`

Unfortunately, someone else got to his idea two millenia ago. Can you find the flag?

NOTE: Remember that the flag will look like `d:ctf{secret-keyword-here}`.
