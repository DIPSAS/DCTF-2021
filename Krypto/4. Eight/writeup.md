Every letter in the message has been swapped out with the phone/SMS keypad combination. 

Replacing the numbers (using `AND` to separate letters), we get:

`3 # 222 8 333 # 7777 8 444 555 555 DASH 7 555 2 999 444 66 4 DASH 66 666 55 444 2 DASH 7777 66 2 55 33 #`

which can be typed out (or entered into https://www.dcode.fr/multitap-abc-cipher) to get the message
