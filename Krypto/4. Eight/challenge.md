Someone has tucked this secret message behind the last page of a comic book:

`THREE SQUARE TWO TWO TWO AND EIGHT AND THREE THREE THREE SQUARE SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN AND EIGHT AND FOUR FOUR FOUR AND FIVE FIVE FIVE AND FIVE FIVE FIVE AND DASH AND SEVEN AND FIVE FIVE FIVE AND TWO AND NINE NINE NINE AND FOUR FOUR FOUR AND SIX SIX AND FOUR AND DASH AND SIX SIX AND SIX SIX SIX AND FIVE FIVE AND FOUR FOUR FOUR AND TWO AND DASH AND SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN AND SIX SIX AND TWO AND FIVE FIVE AND THREE THREE SQUARE`

Can you find the flag hidden within?
